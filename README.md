### Features and Bug Fixes

Open a pull request with your changes. **Make sure to edit the source files (in `PluginName/src/`) and not the bundled plugin.**

### Translations

Add the translations to the `locales.json` file in the plugin's source folder (`PluginName/src/`). Please keep all keys the same and follow the formatting of the file. For the language code, make sure it is exactly the same as one of the language codes available in Discord.
