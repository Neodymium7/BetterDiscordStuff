### Features and Bug Fixes

Open a pull request with your changes. **Make sure to edit the source files (in `PluginName/src/`) and not the bundled plugin.**

### Translations

There are a few simple guidelines for translation contributions:

-   Add the translations to the `locales.json` file in the plugin's source folder (`PluginName/src/`).
-   Follow the formatting of the file.
-   Keep all string keys the same as in the main locale.
-   If the string contains variables that are parsed in the code (such as `"Playing {{ACTIVITY}}"`), please include _every_ included variable in the translation.
-   For the language code, make sure it is exactly the same as one of the language codes available in Discord.
-   If you are translating multiple plugins, please make _one_ pull request for all of your translations.
