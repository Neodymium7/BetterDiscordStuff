# AvatarSettingsButton

## SETTINGS BUTTON WILL DISAPPEAR - This is an intentional part of the plugin. Read below for more information.

Moves the User Settings button to left clicking on the user avatar, with the status picker and context menu still available on configurable actions. 

(Helps reduce clutter, especially with plugins like GameActivityToggle)
