# ActivityIcons - DEPRECATED

**As of March 2025, Discord has redesigned activity statuses, which now include icons when a user is in an activity, similarly to ActivityIcons. Thus, the main reason I had for developing this plugin is now addressed by a native Discord feature. As such, I will not be updating the plugin any further.**

<hr>

Changes the default icons next to statuses

First displays icon for a normal activity, platform, or rich presence, and then an icon for listening to Spotify if applicable. Removes icon for streaming, because you can tell by the purple status anyway, and does not change bot statuses. Works great with ShowAllActivities plugin!
